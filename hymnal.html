I’m but a stranger here,  
Heav’n is my home;  
Earth is a desert drear,  
Heav’n is my home.  
Danger and sorrow stand  
Round me on every hand;  
Heav’n is my fatherland,  
Heav’n is my home.

What though the tempest rage,  
Heav’n is my home;  
Short is my pilgrimage,  
Heav’n is my home;  
And time’s wild wintry blast  
Soon shall be over past;  
I shall reach home at last,  
Heav’n is my home.

There at my Savior’s side  
Heav’n is my home;  
I shall be glorified,

And there I, too, shall rest,  
Heav’n is my home.

1
I saw one weary, sad, and torn,
With eager steps press on the way,
Who long the hallowed cross had born,
Still looking for the promised day;
While many a line of grief and care,
Upon his brow was furrowed there;
I asked what buoyed his spirits up,
“O this” said he-“the blessed hope.”
2
And one I saw, with sword and shield,
Who boldly braved the world’s cold frown,
And fought, unyielding, on the field,
To win an everlasting crown.
Though worn with toil, oppressed by foes,
No murmur from his heart arose;
I asked what buoyed his spirits up,
“O this!” said he-“the blessed hope.”
3
And there was one who left behind
The cherished friends of early years,
And honor, pleasure, wealth re-signed,
To tread the path bedewed with tears.
Through trials deep and conflict sore,
Yet still a smile of joy he wore;
O! what can bouy the spirit up?
‘Tis this alone-the blessed hope.
4
While pilgrims here we journey on
In this dark vale of sin and gloom,
Through tribulation, hate, and scorn,
Or through the portals of the tomb,
Till our returning King shall come
To tkae His exile captives home,
O! what can bouy the spirits up?
‘Tis this alone– the blessed hope.

1
Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide!
When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, O abide with me.
2
Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;
Earth’s joys grow dim; its glories pass away;
Change and decay in all around I see;
O Thou who changest not, abide with me.
3
I need Thy presence every passing hour.
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter’s power?
Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.
4
I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.
Where is death’s sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me!

1
My faith has found a resting place,
Not in a manmade creed;
I trust the ever living One,
That He for me shall plead.
Refrain
I need no other evidence,
I need no other plea;
It is enough that Jesus died,
And rose again for me.
2
Enough for me that Jesus saves,
This ends my fear and doubt;
A sinful soul, I come to Him,
He will not cast me out.
3
My soul is resting on the Word,
The living Word of God,
Salvation in my Savior’s name,
Salvation through His blood.
4
My great Physician heals the sick,
The lost He came to save;
For me His precious blood He shed,
For me His life He gave.

When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,

My sin–oh, the joy of this glorious thought–
My sin, not in part but the whole,
is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

And, Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
the clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
the trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
even so, it is well with my soul.

There’s a land that is fairer than day,

We shall sing on that beautiful shore
The melodious songs of the blest,
And our spirits shall sorrow no more

For the glorious gift of His love
And the blessings that hallow our days.
